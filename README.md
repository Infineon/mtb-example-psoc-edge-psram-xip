# PSOC&trade; Edge MCU: PSRAM read, write, and SMIF cache operations

This code example demonstrates how to interface an external PSRAM using the serial memory interface (SMIF) in octal-SPI DDR mode in Infineon's PSOC&trade; Edge MCUs using the serial memory library. It also demonstrates SMIF cache operations like clean and invalidate using Execute in Place (XIP) and Memory Mapped I/O (MMIO) modes and SMIF XIP encryption and decryption.

This code example has a three project structure: CM33 secure, CM33 non-secure, and CM55 projects. All three projects are programmed to the external QSPI flash and executed in XIP mode. Extended boot launches the CM33 secure project from a fixed location in the external flash, which then configures the protection settings and launches the CM33 non-secure application. Additionally, CM33 non-secure application enables CM55 CPU and launches the CM55 application. This application is in CM33 secure environment.
> **Note:** On the KIT_PSE84_HMI, all three projects are programmed to the external OSPI flash instead of QSPI.

## Hardware setup

This example uses the board's default configuration. See the kit user guide to ensure that the board is configured correctly.

Ensure the following jumper and pin configuration on the board.
- BOOT SW must be in the HIGH/ON position
- J20 and J21 must be in the tristate/not connected (NC) position (for the PSOC&trade; Edge E84 Evaluation Kit)
- All SW8 DIP switches in OFF position (for the PSOC&trade; Edge E846 Evaluation Kit)

## Software setup

See the [ModusToolbox&trade; tools package installation guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxInstallguide) for information about installing and configuring the tools package.

Install a terminal emulator if you do not have one. Instructions in this document use [Tera Term](https://teratermproject.github.io/index-en.html).

This example requires no additional software or tools.


## Operation

See [Using the code example](docs/using_the_code_example.md) for instructions on creating a project, opening it in various supported IDEs, and performing tasks, such as building, programming, and debugging the application within the respective IDEs.

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector

2. Open a terminal program and select the KitProg3 COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud

3. Initially, test the SMIF operations with the cache disabled and XIP encryption and decryption is disabled by setting the value of the `CACHE_ENABLE` and `XIP_ENCRYPT_ENABLE` macro to `0` in *\<application\>/proj_cm33_s/main.c*. The value of both macros is `0` by default

4. After programming, the application starts automatically. Confirm that the following is displayed on the UART terminal

   **Figure 1. Terminal output when cache is disabled**

   ![](images/cache-disable-output.png)

   Since the SMIF cache is disabled, it is bypassed during read and write operations, and hence, the data read from or the data written to the memory address are the same

5. To demonstrate the SMIF cache operations, set the value of the `CACHE_ENABLE` macro to `1` in *\<application\>/proj_cm33_s/main.c*

6. Build and program the application using step 4

7. After programming, the application starts automatically. Confirm that the following is displayed on the UART terminal:

   **Figure 2. Terminal output when cache enabled**

   ![](images/cache-enable-output.png)

   Since the SMIF cache is enabled, the actual data change in the cache or target memory appear after the clean and invalidate operations, as shown in terminal output

8. To demonstrate the SMIF XIP encryption and decryption operations, set the value of the `XIP_ENCRYPT_ENABLE` macro to '1' in *\<application\>/proj_cm33_s/main.c*

   > **Note:** When `XIP_ENCRYPT_ENABLE` is set to `1U`, the `CACHE_ENABLE` macro should be set to `0U` (the cache-disabled path), as the encryption demo operates in the non-cache code path.

9. Clean, build, and program the application as per the steps provided in the operation section

7. After programming, the application starts automatically. Confirm that the following is displayed on the UART terminal:

   **Figure 3. Terminal output when XIP encryption and decryption enabled**

   ![](images/smif-xip-encryption-decryption-enable.png)

   Since XIP encryption and decryption is enabled, the encrypted data is written to PSRAM in MMIO mode, and when the same address is read in XIP mode the SMIF hardware automatically decrypts the data on-the-fly, producing output that matches the original plaintext test data, as shown in terminal output
